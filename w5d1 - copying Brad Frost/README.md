## Week 5, Day 1

### Copying Brad Frost

Ever seen Brad's site?

http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/

Notice the small bubbles in the top? And how they change color when hovered?

Guess what :-)

### Your task

Create a small website with bubbles at the top.

When hovered, they should change color

### Hints

1. You can use illustrator to draw the bubbles and use the SVG
2. You can use div's with a border-radius of 50%

### Optional

1. Generate the bubbles (as `<circle>` or `<div>` elements)
2. Make the color change animated (transition)
3. make sure it works event if the site has real content
