# JS-KATA

## Week 5, Day 3

### Tinder Light

Ever been on tinder? Let's re-create some of it

### Your task

Start by copying either the `females.json` and/or `males.json` from the `materials` folder into `mysolution`.

The JSON files contains a list of users. Each user has a lot of properties, you decide what to show.

As a minimum, you should show the user image / avatar

Underneath each image, you should show two arrows (if not using swipe). One saying "not interested" (swipe left) and one saying "interested" (swiping right).

Clicking/swiping "not interested" takes you to the next person

If the user clicks/swipes "interested", you should check the data to see if the other person is into you (the property is called "inToYou").

If he/she is into you, show some sort of dialog saying "match" or something.

After that, proceed to the next user

### Hints

Swiping is hard, take a look at [hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/getting-started/) is you're curious

If you don't know how Tinder works, that's OK, see what you'll end up making

### Optional

1. Swipe!!!
2. Allow the user to switch which gender he/she is looking for

### Notes

All data take from [randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/)
