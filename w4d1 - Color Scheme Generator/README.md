## Week 4, Day 1

### Color Scheme Generator

Tired of picking out your own colors for that new site?

No more, now you're gonna build your own color scheme generator :-)

### Your task

Generate 5 `<div>`s and give each one a random color.

Print out the color code next to each `<div>`

Print out the css code needed, possibly with classes ready to copy/paste, like

```css
background-color: rgb(23, 45, 254);
```

or

```css
.color1 {
  background-color: hsl(120, 70%, 30%);
}
```

### Optional

Bonus points given for:

1. No duplicate colors (make sure a color is not randomly generated twice)
2. Using `hsl` to keep all colors within the same hue, saturation or lightness
3. Add a button to regenerate all the colors
4. Allowing the user to choose how many colors to generate (or adding, removing colors)
