## Week 4, Day 2

### Background Transitions

Let's work with transitions to change the colors of a `<div>`

### Your task

- Create a `<div>`
- give it a random `background-color`
- The div should change to a random `background-color` every X seconds
- Use CSS's transition to animate the change
- Make sure the newly generated color is not the same as the current one

### Optional

Refactor your code so you can run this on multiple elements
